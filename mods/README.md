# Custom Mods

If you want to run a custom mod, you can do so with the `mods` directory. Your directory setup should look something like the following where you're running either `docker run` or `docker compose` next to where the `mods` directory is located.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ server
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ docker-compose.yml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ mods
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ decay
â”‚   â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ autoexec.cfg
â”‚   â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ models
â”‚   â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ maps
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ svencoop
```

The `mods` directory is volume mapped within the root directory of the Half-Life Dedicated Server client on startup. For example, if you wanted to add a mod named `decay`, you'd place it as a subfolder here, i.e., `mods/decay`. Once the container starts, it would be placed in the following directory within the container.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“¦ hlds
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ cstrike
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ models
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ maps
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ autoexec.cfg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ valve
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ models
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ maps
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ autoexec.cfg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ decay
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ models
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ maps
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ autoexec.cfg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ svencoop
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ models
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ maps
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ autoexec.cfg
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The startup examples posted in the project README already have this directory volume mapped accordingly. If you've strayed from the suggested setup, [please refer back to it to get started](../README.md).

1. Create a folder called `mods` alongside where you would normally start the server process. If you've cloned this project locally, you'd place it alongside this README file.
2. Add your mod files as a sub-directory of `mods`. For example if the mod name is `decay`, you'd place it in `mods/decay`.
3. Define the `GAME` environment variable for your mod name. The dedicated server client will use this to ensure that it starts a server for the correct mod, which corresponds with the directory name that was just created.

```bash
export GAME=decay
```

4. Start the image as you usually would, either with `docker run` or `docker compose up`. Most Half-Life mods require specific startup arguments. For more details, refer to the [Valve Developer Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half-Life_Dedicated_Server) and the instructions for the mod you're trying to run.

> [!TIP]  
> When using a pre-built image, you'll likely want to use the `valve` base image (`jives/hlds:valve`).
